# Resume Screening and Ranking System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Resume Screening and Ranking System** that automates the process of parsing resumes, extracting relevant information (such as skills, education, and experience), and ranking candidates based on their suitability for a given job description. 
The system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning**, and a simple **web interface** for an end-to-end solution.

## ðŸ§© Features

- âœ… **Resume Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**
- âœ… **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for skills, education, and experience
- âœ… **Feature extraction** using TF-IDF and Sentence-BERT
- âœ… **Custom skill extraction** with spaCy Matcher and NER
- âœ… **Semantic matching** using cosine similarity
- âœ… **Candidate ranking** with skill overlap metric
- âœ… **Optional classification** by job categories
- âœ… **Optional fairness and bias mitigation**
- âœ… **Web-based interface** using Streamlit or Flask
